                <br> Childhood obesity affects millions of Americans. In recent decades, rates of childhood obesity  
                have more than tripled, from 5% in 1970, to 19% in 2016. Children  who experience obesity are more likely to remain obese as adults, more than
                doubling risk for chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. For these reasons, 
                childhood obesity poses a significant threat to public health.</p>

                                <p>While a multitude of biological and lifestyle factors influence bodyweight status, evidence suggests that there is a link between exposure to unhealthy food advertising 
                                        and childhood obesity. Previous research has found that most advertisements airing during childrenâ€™s television programs are high in calories, fat, 
                                        sugar, and sodium, and low in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. After being exposed to these ads, research shows that children are more likely to make unhealthy food 
                                        selections. The chronicity of this negative feedback loop leads to poor diet and weight gain.

                                        This line of research is informative for regulatory television programming decisions, but these are not the only types of ads children are exposed to. Stepping out into communities,
                                        we are met with hundreds of ads every minute - from large colorful billboards and store fronts, to small monotone marquees. A large percentage of these ads are for foods and beverages (hereafter food).
                                        To date, research is lacking that investigates the nutritional content of outdoor food advertising, or how exposure to it may be related to childhood obesity. Second only to home, children spend a great deal of their time at and around schools. Thus, these youth serving institutions are a primary mode through which children and adolescents are exposed to 
                                        outdoor Food advertising.</p>

        <p> The Outdoor MEDIA (Measuring and Evaluating the Determinants and Influence of Advertising) Study was designed to document and describe the prevalence of outdoor food advertising 
            around schools, as well is investigate social disparities that may exist in their deployment. The present analysis evaluated food advertising and establishments within a half-mile of 12 
            middle schools and 9 high schools in Austin, TX. Photographs were taken of all outdoor advertisements and ads displaying food and beverage items were coded for nutritional content 
            (i.e. calories, fat, sugar, sodium) using the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR). School-level demographic information on economic disadvantage (i.e. % of students receiving 
            free/reduced price lunch) was obtained from the Texas Education Agency. </p>

                Because % of economically disadvantaged students (%EDS) was not normally distributed, spearman rank-order correlation coefficients were calculated comparing it to total ads, calories, fat, sugar, and sodium. Data were split by >60% EDS, and mean differences were tested for significance using t-tests where normality was shown, and Mann-Whitney U tests were normality was violated.

                A machine learning random forrest framework was then utilized to build a model to predict if an ad was located closest to a high or low %EDS school based on macronutrient content.

<p> Given the strong association between unhealthy ads and low-income communities, as well as demonstrated 
    significant differences in unhealthy macronutrient content based on a binary split of communities  
    SES, it is worth exploring if a prediction can be made at the advertisement-level if that particular 
    ad was placed in in a low- or high- SES community. 
        <p> A random forest model was built using python SciKit-learn. The target prediction was designated as a 
            binary classification of greater than or less than 60% economically disadvantaged. Data was designated 
            as values for kcal, fat, carbohydrate, sodium, and sugar for each ad (n=2268). Data were randomly split 
            into training and testing subsets using the train_test_split SKL function. After training, 200 random 
            estimators were selected and accurately predicted the binary classification 82.7% of the time. Weights
